# Tracks - Layout

## What is this?
Tracks is my take on a local music player. It features basic and simple redirecting to play audio files located on your local disks which is done via a tab and list-based system. Alongside a tab-system it also features a configuration-based memory system which allows you to export, import, and load your own configuration as well as have your own unique shortcuts.

It does currently not feature an icon or any fancy icon.

## How do I use it?
Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/minihazel/Tracks-Public/releases) page and find the latest version.

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/minihazel/Tracks-Public/releases/download/1.0/Tracks.-.Layout.zip) (ends in `.zip`).

Extract the folder (or the two files inside the folder) to somewhere.

Run `Tracks.exe`

## How does the configuration work?
The configuration is a single file called `layout.json` which resides in the same folder as `Tracks.exe`.

It serves as an easy configuration system that can be easily edited both manually and via code.

Once you add a new tab (Settings -> Add tab) the data for that tab will reside in the `layout.json` configuration file.
